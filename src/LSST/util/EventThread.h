/// The classes in this header are meant to provide the basis for easy to use event
/// driven threads. A basic CommandQueue is a simple thread safe fifo, but derived
/// classes can overload the member functions and be very complicated schedulers
/// (see wsched::ScanScheduler, wsched::BlendScheduler, and wsched::GroupScheduler).
///
/// The basic EventThread just runs whatever Command its CommandQueue object hands it.
/// It tells the CommandQueue when each command starts and finishes, which can be
/// ignored. In the case where a Command needs to know something about the EventThread
/// it is running on, specialAction can be overriden.
///
/// The ThreadPool is easy to use and conceptually simple, but has some unusual features
/// that complicate implementation. A ThreadPool is composed of some number of
/// PoolEventThread's that all share a CommandQueue. A Command placed on the CommandQueue
/// may be run by any thread in the pool. A PoolEventThread is simply an EventThread
/// that is aware that it is part of a ThreadPool.
///
/// The ThreadPool starts getting complicated in that there are the unusual cases where
/// a Command decides it should no longer be part of the pool or a CommandQueue scheduler
/// decides that it should no longer wait for that Command to complete. For this there is
/// CommandThreadPool. It is a Command that knows it is in a thread pool and has the
/// capability to have the PoolEventThread leave its ThreadPool. When this is done, the
/// CommandQueue is told the Command is complete and the ThreadPool creates a replacement
/// PoolEventThread.
///
/// The primary case for a thread deciding to leave is that it has reached a point where it
/// expects to need significantly fewer resources than it was using before (such as waiting
/// for something slow to complete before finishing a task). And the primary case for a
/// CommandQueue derived scheduler to cause a Command and its PoolEventThread to leave the
/// ThreadPool is that the command is too slow for that scheduler.
//

/// A queue of Commands meant to drive an EventThread.
